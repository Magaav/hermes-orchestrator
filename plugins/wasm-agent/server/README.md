# wasm-agent Server

`server/` owns both local Python processes used by `wasm-agent`.

- `static_server.py`: account-gated PWA/backend server on `0.0.0.0:8877`
  through `scripts/start_wasm_agent.sh` by default, with
  `HERMES_WASM_AGENT_HOST` available to override the bind address.
- `bridge.py`: wasm-agent-owned Hermes bridge on `127.0.0.1:8790`.
- `routes.py`, `schemas.py`, and `auth.py`: bridge route, schema, and token
  helpers for fleet/node state, resources, logs, lifecycle actions, task
  submission, and host resource summaries.

The bridge routes requests through the Hermes Orchestrator CLI/API boundary.
It must not import Hermes Agent internals or patch runtime node state directly.
